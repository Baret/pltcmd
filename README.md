Control military units only with your radio.

For further information have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Baret/pltcmd/wiki). There are a lot of ideas for things the game might feature in the future.

The game resolves around a map showing a small part of the world map. You control military units moving around on this map. To get an idea of how this might look, there is a mockup:

This is the current state of the UI:
