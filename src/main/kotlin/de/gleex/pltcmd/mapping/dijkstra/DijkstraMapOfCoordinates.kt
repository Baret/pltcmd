    // This should become a better implementation of a dijkstra map
    // It would get a set of coodinates, where you either put a number of "targets" (value 0)
    // and it generates the values of all other tiles.
    // Or you give it a function to calculate the value for every tile.
    // This way we would have a more robust dijkstra map that might also be used later in the game
    // instead of only in map generation.
    // It should be possible to abstract this implementation to also use zircon positions instead of coordinates
    // because you never know... :)
